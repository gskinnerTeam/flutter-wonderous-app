The group organized an event called Semana do Monumento (\"Monument Week\") to attract donations and collect signatures to support the building of the statue. The organization was motivated by what they perceived as \"Godlessness\" in the society.\nThe designs considered for the \"Statue of the Christ\" included a representation of the Christian cross, a statue of Jesus with a globe in his hands, and a pedestal symbolizing the world.",
	"christRedeemerConstructionInfo1": "Artist Carlos Oswald and local engineer Heitor da Silva Costa designed the statue. French sculptor Paul Landowski created the work.

	"colosseumHistoryInfo2": "The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, and the arena was converted into a cemetery. \nThe numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century.",

Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81-96).\nThe Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. The outer wall is estimated to have required over 3.5 million cubic feet of travertine stone which were set without mortar; they were held together by 300 tons of iron clamps.",

	"greatWallHistoryInfo2": "Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BCE, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220-206  BCE), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. \nLater on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls.",
	"greatWallConstructionInfo1": "Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries.",
	"greatWallConstructionInfo2": "Stones cut into rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer brims, and gateways of the wall. \nUnder the rule of the Qing dynasty, China's borders extended beyond the walls and Mongolia was annexed into the empire, so construction was discontinued.",
	"greatWallLocationInfo1": "The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino-Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe.",
	"greatWallLocationInfo2": "Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.",

	"greatWall556ce": "The Bei Qi kingdom also launched several construction projects, utilizing over 1.8 million workers to repair and extend sections of the wall, adding to its length and even building a second inner wall around Shanxi.",

	"machuPicchuHistoryInfo2": "There is a consensus among archeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for his use as a retreat, most likely after a successful military campaign.\nRather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.",
	"machuPicchuConstructionInfo1": "The central buildings use the classical Inca architectural style of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. \nInca walls have many stabilizing features: doors and windows are trapezoidal, narrowing from bottom to top; corners usually are rounded; inside corners often incline slightly into the rooms, and outside corners were often tied together by \"L\"-shaped blocks.",
	"machuPicchuConstructionInfo2": "This precision construction method made the structures at Machu Picchu resistant to seismic activity.\nThe site itself may have been intentionally built on fault lines to afford better drainage and a ready supply of fractured stone.",
	"machuPicchuLocationInfo1": "Machu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for 1,480 feet (450 m) to the river at their base. The location of the city was a military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided natural defenses.",
	"machuPicchuLocationInfo2": "The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge, across the Urubamba River in the Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for the Inca army. Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu, the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that measures 20 feet (6 m).",

	"petraHistoryInfo1": "The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000  BCE, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BCE.\nThe trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain.",
	"petraHistoryInfo2": "Petra flourished in the 1st century CE, when its famous Al-Khazneh structure - believed to be the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV - was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.\nAccess to the city is through a 3/4 mile-long (1.2 km) gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.",
	"petraConstructionInfo1": "Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the \"Red Rose City\" because of the color of the stone from which it is carved.\nAnother thing Petra is known for is its Hellenistic (“Greek”) architecture. These influences can be seen in many of the facades at Petra and are a reflection of the cultures that the Nabataens traded with.",
	"petraConstructionInfo2": "The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos (“dome”) inside, and two obelisks appear to form into the rock of Petra at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury we see twin Greek Gods: Pollux, Castor, and Dioscuri, who protect travelers on their journeys. \nNear the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos. This female figure is believed to be the Isis-Tyche, Isis being the Egyptian Goddess and Tyche being the Greek Goddess of good fortune.",

	"pyramidsGizaHistoryInfo2": "The pyramids of Giza and others are thought to have been constructed to house the remains of the deceased pharaohs who ruled over Ancient Egypt. A portion of the pharaoh's spirit called his ka was believed to remain with his corpse. Proper care of the remains was necessary in order for the former Pharaoh to perform his new duties as king of the dead.",
	"pyramidsGizaConstructionInfo1": "Most construction theories are based on the idea that the pyramids were built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place. In building the pyramids, the architects might have developed their techniques over time.\nThey would select a site on a relatively flat area of bedrock — not sand — which provided a stable foundation. After carefully surveying the site and laying down the first level of stones, they constructed the pyramids in horizontal levels, one on top of the other.",
	"pyramidsGizaConstructionInfo2": "For the Great Pyramid, most of the stone for the interior seems to have been quarried immediately to the south of the construction site. The smooth exterior of the pyramid was made of a fine grade of white limestone that was quarried across the Nile.\nTo ensure that the pyramid remained symmetrical, the exterior casing stones all had to be equal in height and width. Workers might have marked all the blocks to indicate the angle of the pyramid wall and trimmed the surfaces carefully so that the blocks fit together. During construction, the outer surface of the stone was smooth limestone; excess stone has eroded as time has passed.",
	"pyramidsGizaLocationInfo1": "The site is at the edges of the Western Desert, approximately 5.6 miles (9 km) west of the Nile River in the city of Giza, and about 8 miles (13 km) southwest of the city center of Cairo.",

In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.",
	"tajMahalConstructionInfo2": "An area of roughly 3 acres was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and leveled at 160 ft above riverbank. In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb.\nThe plinth and tomb took roughly 12 years to complete.
