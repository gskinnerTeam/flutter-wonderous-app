  historyInfo1:
      '''The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The total length of all sections ever built is over 13,000 miles.
''',
  historyInfo2:
      '''Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.
Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

  constructionInfo1:
      '''Before the use of bricks, the Great Wall was mainly built from rammed earth, stones, and wood. During the Ming, however, bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall, as were materials such as tiles, lime, and stone.
''',
  constructionInfo2:
      '''The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone, so construction quickened. Stones cut into rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer brims, and gateways of the wall. 
Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.
''',
  locationInfo:
      '''The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe.
Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.
