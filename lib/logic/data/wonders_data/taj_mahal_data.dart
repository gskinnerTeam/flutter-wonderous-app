      '''The Taj Mahal is distinguished as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles.
The tomb is the centerpiece of a 42-acre (17-hectare) complex, which include twin mosque buildings (placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum), a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by walls.

      '''The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials
The translucent white marble was brought from Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the lapis from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka. In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.

  constructionInfo2:
      '''It took the efforts of 22,000 laborers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal. 
An area of roughly 3 acres was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and leveled at 160 ft above riverbank. In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb.
The plinth and tomb took roughly 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years.
